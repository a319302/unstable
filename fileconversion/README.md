# fileconversion

This is a Go library to convert various file formats into plaintext and provide related useful functions.

This library is used for https://intelx.io and was successfully tested over 184 million individual files. It is partly written from scratch, partly forked from open source and partly a rewrite of existing code. Many existing libraries lack stability and functionality and this libraries solves that. 

We welcome any contributions - please open issues for any feature requests, bugs, and other related issues.

It supports following file formats for plaintext conversion:

* Word: DOC, DOCX, RTF, ODT
* Excel: XLS, XLSX, ODS
* PowerPoint: PPTX
* PDF
* Ebook: EPUB, MOBI
* Website: HTML

Functions for compressed and container files:

* Decompress files: GZ, BZ, BZ2, XZ
* Extract files from containers: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR

Picture related functions:

* Check if pictures are excessively large
* Compress (and convert) pictures to JPEG: GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF
* Resize and compress pictures
* Extract pictures from PDF files

To download this library:

```
go get -u github.com/IntelligenceX/fileconversion
```

And then use it like:

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/IntelligenceX/fileconversion"
)

const sizeLimit = 2 * 1024 * 1024 // 2 MB

func main() {
	// extract text from an XLSX file
	file, err := os.Open("Test.xlsx")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error opening file: %s\n", err)
		return
	}

	defer file.Close()
	stat, _ := file.Stat()

	buffer := bytes.NewBuffer(make([]byte, 0, sizeLimit))

	fileconversion.XLSX2Text(file, stat.Size(), buffer, sizeLimit, -1)

	fmt.Println(buffer.String())
}
```


## Functions

## Tests

There are no functional tests. The only test functions are used manually for debugging.

## Forks

Other packages were tested and either found insufficient, or unstable. Many of the below listed packages were found to be unstable, cause crashes, as well as exhaust memory due to bad programming, bad input sanitizing and bad memory management.

* `odf` is forked from https://github.com/knieriem/odf
* `ole2` is forked and partly rewritten from https://github.com/extrame/ole2
* `xls` is forked from https://github.com/sergeilem/xls which is a fork from https://github.com/extrame/xls
